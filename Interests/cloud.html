         <h2 style="color:blue"> SaaS - Salesforce </h2>
         <p>Saas stands for software as a service, and is a way of delivering
         centrally hosted applications over the Internetâ€”as a service. Instead
         of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the 
         Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
         There are many advantages to SaaS, none more so than the low initial costs
         and seamless upgrades, minimizing needless stress for customers. SaaS 
         customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update.
         Access to applications is easy, you just need an Internet connection. Customisation
         is also a benefit of SaaS. Users can customise applications to fit their business
         model and needs/desires. These unique customisations are always preserved through
         upgrades, accommodating less customer risk and low adoption costs with upgrades.</p>
