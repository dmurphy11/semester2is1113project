         <h2 style="color:blue"> SaaS - Salesforce </h2>
         
         <p>Saas stands for software as a service, and is a way of delivering
         centrally hosted applications over the Internet, as a service. Instead
         of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the 
         Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
         There are many advantages to SaaS, none more so than the low initial costs
         and seamless upgrades, minimizing needless stress for customers. SaaS 
         customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update.
         Access to applications is easy, you just need an Internet connection. Customisation
         is also a benefit of SaaS. Users can customise applications to fit their business
         model and needs/desires. These unique customisations are always preserved through
         upgrades, accommodating less customer risk and low adoption costs with upgrades.</p>

         <h2 style="color:red"> PaaS - Cloud 9 </h2>
         
         <p>Owned by Amazon, Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment
         that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.
         It includes all  the tools a user would need for web development, including 
         a code editor, debugger and terminal. C9 is also compatible with all major programming 
         languages including JavaScript, PHP and Python to name but a few. C9 can also be linked 
         to Github, a web-based hosting service, and Heroku, a web application deployment 
         model. Not only are all of these services available free of  charge, they were very useful
          for me personally during the development of this project, with C9 acting as the development 
          platform and Heroku providing particularly useful in runninng the application to see how the 
          finished product would look. The live preview feature on C9 was also an efficient way to 
          monitor potential changes to the project. In my eyes, one would find it hard to find a web-development
          platform as stress free and easy to work with as Cloud 9!</p>

         <h2 style="color:green"> IaaS - Amazon </h2>
         
         <p>Amazon web services (AWS), a subsidary of Amazon, provides many computing and networking products/services. 
         During this project I have been able to exploit one of these products, Cloud9. They also have services like 
         Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, which is the equivalent to the Heroku platform which we use, so Amazon really have 
         all bases covered. Amazon launched AWS in July 2002, when the initial revenue generator was amazon selling access
          to virtual servers as a service. What AWS now offer is a secure cloud services platform, data storage and 
          all the tools necessary to allow ones business grow and progress. AWS now has over 100 products and services 
           to its name, from virtual reality to exploiting the very successful "Alexa" for Business. Many apps which young
           people would be very familiar with, Spotify, Shazam and Soundcloud for example, all use AWS to expand storage 
           (Spotify) and deal with spike times (Shazam during the Superbowl). According to the most recent statistics, AWS 
           operates an estimated 1.4 million servers. It is clear Amazon is clearly a lot more than the buy and sell 
           site I once thought it was. The more research one does into it, they discover companies and products that are
           run by Amazon, which they would least expect!</p>
