         <h2 style="color:blue"> SaaS - Salesforce </h2>
         <p>Saas stands for software as a service, and is a way of delivering
         centrally hosted applications over the Internetâ€”as a service. Instead
         of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the 
         Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
         There are many advantages to SaaS, none more so than the low initial costs
         and seamless upgrades, minimizing needless stress for customers. SaaS 
         customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update.
         Access to applications is easy, you just need an Internet connection. Customisation
         is also a benefit of SaaS. Users can customise applications to fit their business
         model and needs/desires. These unique customisations are always preserved through
         upgrades, accommodating less customer risk and low adoption costs with upgrades.</p>

         <h2 style="color:red"> PaaS - Cloud 9 </h2>
         <p>Owned by Amazon, Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment
         that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.
         It includes all  the tools a user would need for web development, including 
         a code editor, debugger and terminal. C9 is also compatible with all major programming 
         languages including JavaScript, PHP and Python to name but a few. C9 can also be linked 
         to Github, a web-based hosting service, and Heroku, a web application deployment 
         model. Not only are all of these services available free of  charge, they were very useful
          for me personally during the development of this project, with C9 acting as the development 
          platform and Heroku providing particularly useful in runninng the application to see how the 
          finished product would look. The live preview feature on C9 was also an efficient way to 
          monitor potential changes to the project. In my eyes, one would find it hard to find a web-development
          platform as stress free and easy to work with as Cloud 9!</p>
