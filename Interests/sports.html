        <p>Barryroe GAA is a small rural club, founded in 1892, which competes in the carbery (West 
        Cork) division. Hurling would be stroger than football in Barryroe, with women's camogie and 
        ladies football teams also present. Due to a lack of numbers for recent underage teams, Barryroe 
        has formed an amalgamation with nearby club Argideen Rangers. This has allowed young players to 
        play at a higher grade, thus improving themselves, benefiting their respective clubs when they 
        return to play at adult level. Barryroe have always played in a sky blue and navy kit, and are 
       well known as "The Blues".</p>
