         <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:arial;">My name is David Murphy, and I am  first year student in University College Cork, 
         studying BIS. I am enjoying the course very much, and I am very happy I chose BIS, 
         having had small doubts before entering the course last September. At school Accounting 
         and Business were always my favourite subjects, and I have also grown to love the coding 
         and technology aspect of the course, as tricky as it may be at first. This project is a 
         bit about myself, and also includes an e-business which is not real! I hope you enjoy 
         exploring my project as much as I enjoyed developing it!</p>
